    The distribution of passenger vehicles is a complex task and a high cost factor for automotive original
equipment manufacturers (OEMs). On the way from the production plant to the customer, vehicles travel
long distances on different carriers such as ships, trains, and trucks. To save costs, OEMs and logistics service
providers aim to maximize their loading capacities. Modern auto carriers are extremely flexible. Individual
platforms can be rotated, extended, or combined to accommodate vehicles of different shapes and weights
and to nest them in a way that makes the best use of the available space. In practice, finding feasible
combinations is done with the help of simple heuristics or based on personal experience. In research, most
papers that deal with auto carrier loading focus on route or cost optimization. Only a rough approximation
of the loading sub-problem is considered. We formulate the problem as a mixed integer quadratically constrained
assignment problem.
