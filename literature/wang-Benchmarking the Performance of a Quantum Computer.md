## Relevance for BenchQC

Chapter 5. Application-Based Benchmarks
* several benchmarking concepts for QC-application are shown
** especially interesting: QPack --> combines the following terms:
*** Runtime
*** best approximation error
*** success probability
*** performance scaling
-->is a benchmark that is especially fitting for the QAOA, which also needs the classical hardware
