    """
    \"The famous travelling salesman problem (also called the travelling salesperson problem or in short TSP) is a
    well-known NP-hard problem in combinatorial optimization, asking for the shortest possible route that visits each
    node exactly once, given a list of nodes and the distances between each pair of nodes. Applications of the
    TSP can be found in planning, logistics, and the manufacture of microchips. In these applications, the general
    concept of a node represents, for example, customers, or points on a chip.

    TSP as graph problem: The solution to the TSP can be viewed as a specific ordering of the vertices in a weighted
    graph. Taking an undirected weighted graph, nodes correspond to the graph's nodes, with paths corresponding to the
    graph's edges, and a path's distance is the edge's weight. Typically, the graph is complete where each pair of nodes
    is connected by an edge. If no connection exists between two nodes, one can add an arbitrarily long edge to complete
    the graph without affecting the optimal tour.\"
