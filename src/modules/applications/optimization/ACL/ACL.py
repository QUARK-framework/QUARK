    The distribution of passenger vehicles is a complex task and a high cost factor for automotive original
    equipment manufacturers (OEMs). Vehicles travel long distance on different carriers, such as ships,
    trains, and trucks, from the production plant to the customer.

    To save costs, OEMs and logistics service providers aim to maximize their loading capacities.
    Modern auto carriers are flexible, allowing individual platforms to be rotated, extended, or combined
    to accommodate vehicles of different shapes and weights in a space-efficient manner.

    In practice, finding feasible combinations is often based on heuristics or personal experience.
    We formulate the problem as a mixed integer quadratically constrained assignment problem.
