## Relevance for BenchQC

* really good paper about application based benchmarks for QCs
* explains quantum volume --> could be used for differences between Quantum computers with different hardware quality during our research
-->A device’s quantum volume is defined to be 2n with n being both the width (the number of qubits) and the depth (the number of layers) of the largest quantum volume circuits that can be executed ‘successfully’ on a specified quantum device.
-->A device is considered to implement n-qubit quantum volume circuits successfully if, on average, it produces more ‘heavy outputs’ than a set threshold of 2=3 with two-sigma confidence
* introduces volumetric benchmarks
* doesn't include benchmarks that are specific to QAOA
* introduces a template for a benchmarking process (-->loops for problem sizes, circuit size, circuitparameters)
