# QUARK: A Framework for Quantum Computing Application Benchmarking

Quantum Computing Application Benchmark (QUARK) is a framework for orchestrating benchmarks of different industry applications on quantum computers. 
QUARK supports various applications such as the traveling salesperson problem (TSP), the maximum satisfiability (MaxSAT) problem, robot path optimization in the PVC sealing use case 
as well as new additions like the Maximum Independent Set (MIS), Set Cover Problem (SCP) and Auto Carrier Loading (ACL).
It also features different solvers (e.g., simulated /quantum annealing and the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA)), quantum devices (e.g., IonQ and Rigetti), and simulators.
It is designed to be easily extendable in all of its components: applications, mappings, solvers, devices, and any other custom modules.

## Publications
Details about the motivations for the original framework can be found in the [accompanying QUARK paper from FinÅ¾gar et al](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.03028).
Even though the architecture changes significantly from QUARK 1.0 to the current version, the guiding principles still remain. The most recent publication from [Kiwit et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04082) provides an updated overview of the functionalities and quantum machine learning features of QUARK.

## Documentation
Documentation with a tutorial and developer guidelines can be found here: https://quark-framework.readthedocs.io/en/dev/.

## Prerequisites

### Step 1: Install Python 3.12
QUARK requires **Python 3.12**. You need to install this version of Python if you do not already have it installed.
Other versions could cause issues with other dependencies used in the framework.
1. Visit the [Python Downloads Page](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and install Python 3.12.
2. Verify your Python version:
   
   ```python --version```

3. Ensure it returns Python 3.12.x

### Step 2: Create a Conda Environment
QUARK provides flexibility in managing its environment using Conda. Create and activate a Conda environment:
1. Create a Conda environment:

    ```conda create -n quark python=3.12```

    ```conda activate quark```

### Step 3: Install Required Packages
Additionally, we rely on several pip dependencies, which you can install in two ways:

1. Install pip packages manually, or
2. Use the QUARK installer.
   For this installer to work, you need to install the following packages in the first place:

   * inquirer==3.4.0
   * pyyaml==6.0.2
   * packaging==24.2

   To limit the number of packages you need to install, there is an option to only include a subselection of QUARK modules.
   You can select the modules of choice via :

   ```python src/main.py env --configure myenv```

   This will generate a requirements file ```requirements_myenv.txt``` that you can use to set up a customized conda environment.

   ```pip install -r .settings/envs/requirements_myenv.txt```
      
   If you want to set up the default configuration (which installs all dependencies needed for the full QUARK framework):

   ```pip install -r .settings/requirements_full.txt```

   Activate the environment:

   ```python src/main.py env --activate myenv```

   You can also configure multiple QUARK environments and then switch between them, e.g. via:

   ```python src/main.py env --activate myenv2```

   > __Note:__ Different modules require different python packages.
   > Be sure that your python environment has the necessary packages installed!
   Ensure the environment is properly configured:

   To see which environments are configured, please use

   ```python src/main.py env --list```

   You can also visualize the contents of your QUARK environment:
   
   ```
   (quark) %  python src/main.py env --show myenv
   [...]
   Content of the environment:
   >-- TSP
       >-- GreedyClassicalTSP
           >-- Local
   ```

> __Note:__ In case you want to use custom modules files (for example, to use external modules from other repositories), you can still use the ```--modules``` option.
> You can find the documentation in the respective Read the Docs section.

## Git Large File Storage (LFS)
QUARK stores data and config files using **Git LFS**. If you are contributing to this project or cloning this repository, ensure that you have **Git LFS** installed and configured to manage large files effectively.

### Installing Git LFS
Install Git LFS by following the instructions on [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.com/):
  - On Linux/macOS
    ```bash
    git lfs install
    ```
  - On Windows. Download and install Git LFS from the [Official page](https://git-lfs.com/)

## Running a Benchmark

#### Setting Global Variables
```bash
export HTTP_PROXY=http://username:password@proxy.com:8080 
export AWS_PROFILE=quantum_computing
export AWS_REGION=us-west-1
```
`HTTP_PROXY` is only needed if you have to use a proxy to access AWS.

`AWS_PROFILE` is only needed if you want to use an AWS braket device (default is quantum_computing). In case no profile is needed in your case, please set `export AWS_PROFILE=default`.

`AWS_REGION` is only needed if you need another aws region than us-east-1. Usually this is specific to the Braket device.

#### Interactive Mode
You can run QUARK using
```
python src/main.py
```
This will initiate an interactive configuration mode to describe what you want to benchmark. After finishing the configuration, the benchmark run begins automatically. The results and the configuration ```config.yml``` file are saved with a timestamp in ```benchmark_runs```.

#### Non-Interactive Mode
It is also possible to start the script with a config file instead of using the interactive mode:
```
 python src/main.py --config config.yml
```

> __Note:__ This should only be used by experienced users as invalid values will cause the framework to fail!

Example for a config file:

```
application:
  config:
    nodes:
    - 3
  name: TSP
  submodules:
  - config: {}
    name: GreedyClassicalTSP
    submodules:
    - config: {}
      name: Local
      submodules: []
repetitions: 1
```

### Running Specific Modules

If you want to run specific modules, use the preconfigured YAML files under tests/config/valid/. 

For example:

```python src/main.py -c tests/config/valid/TSP.yml```

Replace TSP.yml with the desired module configuration (e.g., MIS.yml, generativemodeling.yml, etc.)
> __Note:__ This should only be used by experienced users as invalid values will cause the framework to fail!

```

All used config files, logs and results are stored in a folder in the ```benchmark_runs``` directory.

### Interrupt/resume
The processing of backlog items may get interrupted in which case you will see something like
```
2024-03-13 10:25:20,201 [INFO] ================================================================================
2024-03-13 10:25:20,201 [INFO] ====== Run 3 backlog items with 10 iterations - FINISHED:15 INTERRUPTED:15
2024-03-13 10:25:20,201 [INFO] ====== There are interrupted jobs. You may resume them by running QUARK with
2024-03-13 10:25:20,201 [INFO] ====== --resume-dir=benchmark_runs\tsp-2024-03-13-10-25-19
2024-03-13 10:25:20,201 [INFO] ================================================================================
```
This happens if you press CTRL-C or if some QUARK module does its work asynchronously, e.g. by submitting its job to some 
batch system. Learn more about how to write asynchronous modules in the [developer guide](https://quark-framework.readthedocs.io/en/dev/).
You can resume an interrupted QUARK run by calling: 
```
python src/main.py --resume-dir=<result-dir>
```
Note that you can copy/paste the ```--resume-dir``` option from the QUARK output as shown in the above example.

### Run as Container
We also support the option to run the framework as a container.
After making sure your docker daemon is running, you can run the container:
```
docker run -it --rm ghcr.io/quark-framework/quark
```

> __Note__: ARM builds are (temporarily) removed in release 2.1.3 because pyqubo 1.5.0 is unavailable for this platform
> at the moment. This means if you want to run QUARK as a container on a machine with a chip from this 
> [list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ARM_processors) you might face problems. Please feel free to 
> [open an issue](https://github.com/QUARK-framework/QUARK/issues/new), so we can work on a tailored workaround until 
> the latest version of pyqubo is available on ARM platforms.

You can also build the docker image locally like:
``` 
docker build -t ghcr.io/quark-framework/quark .
```

In case you want to use a config file you have to add it to the docker run command: 
```
-v /Users/alice/desktop/my_config.yml:/my_config.yml
```
`/Users/alice/desktop/my_config.yml` specifies the QUARK config file on your local machine.
Then you can run the docker container with the config:
```
docker run -it --rm  -v /Users/alice/desktop/my_config.yml:/my_config.yml ghcr.io/quark-framework/quark --config my_config.yml
```

In case you want to access the benchmark run folder afterwards, you can attach a volume to the run command:
```
-v /Users/alice/desktop/benchmark_runs:/benchmark_runs/
```
The results of the benchmark run are then stored to a new directory in `/Users/alice/desktop/benchmark_runs`.

In case you have local proxy settings you can add the following flags to the run command:

```
-e http_proxy=$http_proxy -e https_proxy=$https_proxy -e HTTP_PROXY=$HTTP_PROXY -e HTTPS_PROXY=$HTTPS_PROXY
```

AWS credentials can be mounted to the run command like:
```
-v $HOME/.aws/:/root/.aws:ro
```



#### Summarizing Multiple Existing Experiments
You can also summarize multiple existing experiments like this:
```
python src/main.py --summarize quark/benchmark_runs/2021-09-21-15-03-53 quark/benchmark_runs/2021-09-21-15-23-01
```
This allows you to generate plots from multiple experiments.
