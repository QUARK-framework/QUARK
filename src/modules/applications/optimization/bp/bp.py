    """
    The bin packing problem is a classic optimization challenge where items of varying sizes must be efficiently packed 
    into a finite number of bins, each with a fixed capacity, aiming to minimize the number of bins utilized. This problem 
    is computationally NP-hard, meaning that finding an exact solution in a reasonable time frame is often impractical 
    for large datasets. Consequently, various approximation algorithms have been developed to provide near-optimal solutions 
    within acceptable time limits.

    In practical applications, bin packing is prevalent in industries such as logistics and manufacturing. For instance,
    it is used in loading trucks with weight capacity constraints, filling containers to maximize space utilization, and creating
    file backups in media storage. Additionally, it plays a role in technology mapping for FPGA semiconductor chip design, 
    where efficient resource allocation is crucial.

    To address the bin packing problem, several heuristic and approximation methods have been proposed. One common approach is 
    the First-Fit Decreasing (FFD) algorithm, which involves sorting items in descending order by size and then placing each 
    item into the first bin that can accommodate it. While FFD does not always yield an optimal solution, it is effective and 
    widely used due to its simplicity and efficiency. Other advanced techniques, such as Best-Fit and Karmarkarâ€“Karp algorithms,
    offer improved performance for specific scenarios by considering different strategies for item placement and bin selection.
