	abstract={The best performing exact algorithms for the capacitated vehicle routing problem developed in the last 10 years are based in the combination of cut and column generation. Some authors only used cuts expressed over the variables of the original formulation, in order to keep the pricing subproblem relatively easy. Other authors could reduce the duality gaps by also using a restricted number of cuts over the master LP variables, stopping when the pricing becomes prohibitively hard. A particularly effective family of such cuts are the subset row cuts. This work introduces a technique for greatly reducing the impact on the pricing of these cuts, thus allowing much more cuts to be added. The newly proposed branch-cut-and-price algorithm also incorporates and combines for the first time (often in an improved way) several elements found in previous works, like route enumeration and strong branching. All the instances used for benchmarking exact algorithms, with up to 199 customers, were solved to optimality. Moreover, some larger instances with up to 360 customers, only considered before by heuristic methods, were solved too.},

	abstract = {The recent research on the CVRP is being slowed down by the lack of a good set of benchmark instances. The existing sets suffer from at least one of the following drawbacks: (i) became too easy for current algorithms; (ii) are too artificial; (iii) are too homogeneous, not covering the wide range of characteristics found in real applications. We propose a new set of 100 instances ranging from 100 to 1000 customers, designed in order to provide a more comprehensive and balanced experimental setting. Moreover, the same generating scheme was also used to provide an extended benchmark of 600 instances. In addition to having a greater discriminating ability to identify “which algorithm is better”, these new benchmarks should also allow for a deeper statistical analysis of the performance of an algorithm. In particular, they will enable one to investigate how the characteristics of an instance affect its performance. We report such an analysis on state-of-the-art exact and heuristic methods.}

	abstract = { The paper is concerned with the optimum routing of a fleet of gasoline delivery trucks between a bulk terminal and a large number of service stations supplied by the terminal. The shortest routes between any two points in the system are given and a demand for one or several products is specified for a number of stations within the distribution system. It is desired to find a way to assign stations to trucks in such a manner that station demands are satisfied and total mileage covered by the fleet is a minimum A procedure based on a linear programming formulation is given for obtaining a near optimal solution. The calculations may be readily performed by hand or by an automatic digital computing machine. No practical applications of the method have been made as yet. A number of trial problems have been calculated, however. }

The formulated CVRP is equipped with time-table which describes time-evolution of each vehicle. Therefore, various constraints associated with time can be successfully realized. Similarly, constraints of capacities are also introduced, where capacitated quantities are allowed to increase and decrease according to the cities in which vehicles arrive. As a bonus of capacity-qubits, one can also obtain a description of state, which allows us to set various traveling rules, depending on the state of each vehicle. As a consistency check, the proposed QUBO formulation is also evaluated using a quantum annealing machine, D-Wave 2000Q.",

Both algorithms contain important classical components, but we also present two other algorithms, Full QUBO Solver and Average Partitioning Solver, which can be run only on a quantum processing unit (without CPU) and were prototypes which helped us develop better hybrid approaches. In order to validate our methods, we run comprehensive tests using D-Wave's Leap framework on well-established benchmark test cases as well as on our own test scenarios built based on realistic road networks. We also compared our new quantum and hybrid methods with classical algorithms - well-known metaheuristics for solving VRP and CVRP. The experiments indicate that our hybrid methods give promising results and are able to find solutions of similar or even better quality than the tested classical algorithms.",

	abstract = {Quantum Annealing was previously applied to the vehicle routing problem and the results were promising. For all benchmark instances in the study, optimal results were obtained. However, 100% success rate was not achieved in every case, and tuning the control parameters for larger instances proved cumbersome. This work addresses these remaining difficulties. An empirical approach is taken wherein measurements of run-time behaviour are exploited to transform existing good values of control parameters so that they can be used successfully for other problem instances. The course of this work shows a method which simplifies hand-tuning so that the heuristic performs successfully when applied to larger instances, and also demonstrates a tuning method which establishes control parameter values for instances which belong in broadly defined groupings. In addition, new best known solutions for large-scale instances, and initial results for the distance-constrained variant of the vehicle routing problem are presented.}
