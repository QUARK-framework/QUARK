## Relevance for BenchQC

* introduces a benchmarking concept that combines solution quality and solution time: "Time-to-solution"
* TTS(beta, gamma) = R99(beta, gamma) * tss 
--> R99 is the number of shots that must be performed to ensure a 99% probability of observing the ground state of HP.
--> tss is the time taken for a single shot
