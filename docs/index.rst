Welcome to QUARK's Documentation!
=================================

**QUantum computing Application benchmaRK** (QUARK) is a framework for designing, implementing, executing, and analyzing
benchmarks. The QUARK framework aims to facilitate the development of application-level benchmarks. The framework simplifies
the end-to-end process of designing, implementing, conducting, and communicating application benchmarks.

**Note:** This documentation is currently being built and is not complete!

The following figure depicts the main components of the framework. The framework
follows the separation of concerns design principle encapsulating application- and problem-specific aspects, mappings
to mathematical formulations, solvers, hardware or other custom module definitions.

Publications
============

Details about the motivations for the original framework can be found in the [accompanying QUARK paper from Fin≈ægar et al](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.03028). The data used for the paper can be found in ``results/results.csv``. Even though the architecture changes significantly from QUARK 1.0 to 2.0, the guiding principles still remain. The most recent publication from [Kiwit et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04082) provides an updated overview of the functionalities and quantum machine learning features of QUARK 2.0.
