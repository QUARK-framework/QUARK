# TODOs

* Think about how to support devices that are currently in use and not available (e.g. some devices are sometimes in maintenance)
* Implement a check whether the current problem size can even be run on the current devices (compare needed qubits to the qubits of the device)
* Implement a way to calculate the costs of the device if it is a cloud-based device
* Validate configs in non-interactive mode
* Support solvers in other languages (https://wiki.python.org/moin/IntegratingPythonWithOtherLanguages)
* Maybe implement: https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-0.14.0/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.anneal.html
* Research on GPU simulators besides qulac (e.g. https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-aer)
* Support more embeddings for Annealing
* Determine the influence on quantum annealing of finding the embedding (how long does it take)
