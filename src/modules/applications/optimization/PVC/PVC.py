class PVC(Optimization):
    """
    In modern vehicle manufacturing, robots take on a significant workload, including performing welding
    jobs, sealing welding joints, or applying paint to the car body. While the robot’s tasks vary widely,
    the objective remains the same: Perform a job with the highest possible quality in the shortest amount
    of time, optimizing efficiency and productivity on the manufacturing line.

    For instance, to protect a car’s underbody from corrosion, exposed welding seams are sealed
    by applying a polyvinyl chloride layer (PVC). The welding seams need to be traversed by a robot to
    apply the material. It is related to TSP, but different and even more complex in some aspects.

    The problem of determining the optimal route for robots to traverse all seams shares similarities
    with Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), as it involves finding the shortest possible route to
    visit multiple locations. However, it introduces additional complexities, such as different tool
    and configuration requirements for each seam, making it an even more challenging problem to solve.
