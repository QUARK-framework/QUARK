    In modern vehicle manufacturing, robots
    take on a significant workload, including performing welding
    jobs, sealing welding joints, or applying paint to the car body.
    While the robot’s tasks vary widely, the objective remains
    the same: Perform a job with the highest possible quality in the
    shortest amount of time. For instance, to protect a car’s underbody
    from corrosion, exposed welding seams are sealed by applying
    a polyvinyl chloride layer (PVC). The welding seams need to be
    traversed by a robot to apply the material.
    It is related to TSP, but different and even more complex in some
    aspects.
