# Summary

## Project Coordination
- Protocol rotates now
- beginning in 2024 we are going to have biweekly meetings. A doodle poll will be created

## Metrics research (IIS)
- Main metrics: runtime, solution quality
- other metrics from papers: "R99", TTS (time-to-solution), Q-Score, SupermarQ, LINPACK, best approximation error, success probability
- Q-score as metric does not fit that well because it is a metric that also incorporates the hardware
- todo: create documentation files in git for 
    - a) links to papers (-> .md-file) and 
    - b) summary for the metrics (->.pdf-file)

- there was a short discussion about the possibilities to reformulate the problem to make it fitting for a quantum computer

# To-dos
