## Relevance for BenchQC


*important things to look at during benchmarking:
 - resource cost (energy costs?, normally really difficult to get)
 - run time (including pre- and post-processing?, time for different parts of the process?)
 - quality (goal: optimal or feasible?, how far away from optimal? Solution diversity?)
 - problem complexity (number of variables, number of constraints, variable connections)

*interesting other problem applications where quantum advantage could be studied:
 - maximum independent set
 - multi dimensional knapsack
 - Low Autocorrelation Binary Sequences
 - Quadratic Assignment Problem
 - Sports Timetabling Problems
