class SAT(Optimization):
    """
    The SAT (Satisfiability) problem plays a crucial role in the field of computational optimization. In the context
    of vehicle manufacturing, it is essential to test various pre-series vehicle configurations to ensure they meet
    specific requirements before production begins. This testing involves making sure that each vehicle configuration
    complies with several hard constraints related to safety, performance, and buildability while also fulfilling
    soft constraints such as feature combinations or specific requirements for testing. The SAT problem models these
    constraints in a way that enables a systematic approach to determine feasible vehicle configurations and minimize
    the need for excessive physical prototypes.

    This problem is modeled as a Max-SAT problem, where the aim is to find a configuration that satisfies as many
    constraints as possible while balancing between the number of satisfied hard and soft constraints. The formulation
    uses a conjunctive normal form (CNF) representation of logical expressions to model the dependencies and
    incompatibilities between various features and components in vehicle assembly. By leveraging optimization
    algorithms, the SAT module aims to produce a minimal but sufficient set of configurations, ensuring that all
    necessary tests are performed while minimizing resource usage. This approach helps in creating a robust testing
    framework and reducing the overall cost of vehicle development.

    To solve the SAT problem, various approaches are employed, including translating the CNF representation into
    different quantum and classical optimization mappings such as QUBO (Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization)
    or Ising formulations. These mappings make the SAT problem suitable for solving on quantum computers and
    classical annealers. The SAT problem in this module is implemented with a flexible interface, allowing integration
    with a range of solvers that can exploit different computational paradigms, making it adaptable for a variety of
    hardware and optimization backends.
