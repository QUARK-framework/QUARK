class SCP(Optimization):
    """
    The set cover problem (SCP) is a classical combinatorial optimization problem where the objective is to find the
    smallest subset of given elements that covers all required elements in a collection. This can be formulated as
    selecting the minimum number of sets from a collection such that the union of the selected sets contains all
    elements from the universe of the problem instance.

    SCP has widespread applications in various fields, including sensor positioning, resource allocation, and network
    design. For example, in sensor positioning, SCP can help determine the fewest number of sensors required to cover
    a given area. Similarly, in resource allocation, SCP helps to allocate resources in an optimal way, ensuring
    coverage of all demand points while minimizing costs. Network design also uses SCP principles to efficiently place
    routers or gateways in a network to ensure full coverage with minimal redundancy.

    This implementation of SCP provides configurable problem instances of different sizes, such as "Tiny," "Small,"
    and "Large," allowing the user to explore solutions with varying complexities. We employ various quantum-inspired
    methods to solve SCP, including a mapping to the QUBO (Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization) formulation
    using Qubovert. These approaches allow us to explore how different optimization algorithms and frameworks perform
    when applied to this challenging problem, offering insights into both classical and emerging quantum methods.
